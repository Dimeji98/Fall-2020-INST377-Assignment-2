INST377 Assignment 2 Group 8
## Project description
Build a typeahead filtered list from scratch. At the end, a user will be able to type a term into the input box, and a filtered list nicely styled with CSS will turn up on the page. The page's HTML, CSS, and Javascript files are within the public folder. I was instrumental in the development of the Javascript search and return logic.
